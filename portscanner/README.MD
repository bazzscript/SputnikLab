This Script Scans 1-1000 Ports of given target(s), identifies the open ports and prints the services/application/software running on each one(open port).

This is very useful in pentesting, when you are trying to check whether there is any vulnerable service(s) running on any of the target port, which you can exploit and gain access to the target.
